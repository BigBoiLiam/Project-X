# Three cheers for All of Our *ahem my* Hard work 
Gabriel some enemies at the bottom of the initialization list still don't have adjusted stats. Other than that everything should be done so all you guys need to do is debug the game, just keep playing and trying to break the game and see what happens

oh and also go to Dungeon.java line 319 onwards for a list of debug commands to help you test stuff. first type the code (111) then after that you can use commands without entering the code again.
